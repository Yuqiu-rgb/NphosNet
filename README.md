# NphosNet
NphosNet: A Deep Learning Model for Predicting Protein N-Phosphorylation Sites Based on Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) and Enhanced Features with a Weighted Three-Channel Cross-Attention Strategy

1.Requirements

	pandas

	scikit-learn

	transformers

	matplotlib

	umap-learn

Please download torch version>=2.0 or above to avoid version conflicts

Please refer to the download version of xlstm to https://github.com/NX-AI/xlstm

2.Data

	I will upload the data to OneDrive, or readers can contact me via email

3.ProtT5 and EMBERE2 embeeding 

	You may also refer to https://github.com/agemagician/ProtTrans for detailed explanations.

	You may also refer to https://github.com/kWeissenow/EMBER2 for detailed explanations.

	And place the weights of ProtT5 in the "prot_t5-xx_half_unref50 enc" directory, or you can directly place the generated embedding representation in the "embedding" directory, and the embeddings generated by EMBER2 are also placed in the "embedding" directory.
